# Zoo Management â€“ Full-Stack (Spring Boot 3 & Angular)

Portfolio-oriented, production-like REST API for managing animals, vet visits, medications, feed logs, diet plans, and weight logs.
Clear business rules (400/404/409), global exception handling, and JWT-based security. Frontend: Angular admin UI integrates with this API.

## Features
- Domains: animals, vet visits, medications, feed logs, diet plans, weight logs (RESTful CRUD).
- Business rules: duplicate/overlap detection returns 409; validation errors return 400; missing resources return 404.
- Date/range logic: per-domain guards (e.g., same animal + timestamp or date-range cannot overlap).
- Security: JWT/Bearer authentication; obtain token via /api/auth/login and send with Authorization: Bearer <token>.
- Documentation and testing: Swagger/OpenAPI UI for exploration; Postman collection for smoke tests (CRUD + conflict).
- Persistence: H2 in-memory by default; MySQL configuration supported.
- Serialization: safe JSON for lazy relations to avoid cycles (e.g., ignore back-references, expose animalId).
